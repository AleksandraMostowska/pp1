# 45.	A natural number greater than 1 is called a prime if it has exactly 2 natural factors with 
# the values 1 and this number. Write a program that finds N leading prime numbers. 
# Read the value of N from the keyboard. Using loop statements check that the number N 
# is divisible only by 1 and by N.
# Prime numbers: 2 3 5 7 11 â€¦
